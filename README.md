# 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Java  

This project demonstrates the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by implementing unit tests to drive the development of a Java application. It follows a **red-green-refactor** workflow to ensure reliability and maintainability.  

## 📌 Features  

- **Unit Testing with JUnit** – Implements test cases before writing the actual implementation.  
- **Red-Green-Refactor Approach** – Encourages writing minimal code to pass tests before refining.  
- **Assertions & Test Coverage** – Uses assertions to validate expected behavior.  
- **Separation of Concerns** – Maintains clean code with testable methods.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Java** – Core language for the implementation.  
- **JUnit** – Framework for running automated unit tests.  
- **Maven/Gradle (if applicable)** – Build and dependency management.
